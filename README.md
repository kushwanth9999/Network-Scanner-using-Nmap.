# 🛰️ Network Scanner using Nmap

This project demonstrates the use of **Nmap** on **Kali Linux** for network discovery, port scanning, and OS detection within a controlled environment.


## 📘 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform network reconnaissance and analyze target system behavior using various **Nmap commands**.

### Key Objectives:
- Identify open ports and running services  
- Detect service versions and operating systems  
- Analyze network responses and configurations  


## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **VMware Workstation Pro** – Host system  
- **Kali Linux** – Guest OS (Penetration Testing Environment)  
- **Target System:** Virtual Windows Environment (192.168.199.1)


## ⚙️ Nmap Commands Used
```bash
nmap <target IP>           # Basic scan  
nmap -sV <target IP>       # Service/version detection  
nmap -O <target IP>        # OS detection  
```


## 🧩 Results & Analysis
- Successfully identified open ports and active services  
- Detected the operating system with high accuracy  
- Demonstrated practical understanding of **network mapping** and **vulnerability detection**  


## 🏁 Conclusion
This project showcases practical skills in **network scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability analysis**, emphasizing Nmap’s importance in **cybersecurity auditing**.
